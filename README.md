:bulb: **Multi-Scale Segmentation Mechanism** :Optimizing lookback window length is essential for robust forecasting.
A multi-scale segmentation mechanism partitions input sequences into different scales, processes them independently, 
and aggregates the outputs to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies, improving prediction accuracy and model robustness.


We will gradually open part of the code and part of the dataset. The source code will be opened after the paper is accepted. It is currently being organized.
